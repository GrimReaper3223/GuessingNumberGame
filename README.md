*********************
---------------------
@Deprecated project
---------------------
This project has been discontinued due to poor code quality and severe bugs.
---------------------
A new remastered version, which will feature a TUI using the Lanterna framework and with more features is being developed, according to my studies in Java and will soon be uploaded to a new repository;
---------------------
*********************
			
Operation:

Basically, the game consists of guessing a randomly generated number within a specific range, according to the selected level.
For each wrong result, a simple hint is generated, providing the user with a direction.

<hr>

***Levels:***

 - If the selected level is easy, a random number from 0 to 100 will be generated;
 - If the selected level is intermediate, a random number from 0 to 200 will be generated;
 - If the selected level is difficult, a random number from 0 to 500 will be generated;
 - If the selected level is veteran, a random number from 0 to 1000 will be generated;
 - And if the selected level is Custom, the user will need to configure the level before starting a custom game;
	|
	--- If the user does not configure a level, the game will not start due to lack of basic data to run the custom level engine.

<hr>

***Project Status***

The game is still going through some improvements. This version will be **ALPHA**.
Many improvements have been made in this new version. The next versions will include new features and better gameplay.

In the future, the game will gain a TUI (Text-User Interface), as I am thinking about how to learn how to manipulate elements in closed packages (applications)

If the implementations (not only these, but also the future ones) work out, I will constantly update the project here so that it always has a better and functional version.

<hr>

***Test Yourself:***

--- To clone this repository on your machine, use the following command in your linux terminal, termux or Windows cmd:

    git clone https://github.com/GrimReaper3223/GuessingNumberGame

--- I will also be leaving a .jar executable for those who want to run it directly in the terminal or in cmd.

--- The syntax to run this game in the terminal is just below:

**Note: To run the projects through the terminal, enter the 'target' folder and execute the commands below* 
	
<hr>

**Linux & Termux:**
		
    java -jar GuessingNumberGame-3.0_ALPHA.jar

<hr>

**Windows:**

For Windows users, the folder comes with a .bat script that executes the same code above, just by double clicking on it.

<hr>

--- Both files (.jar and .bat) will be in the following directory:

	GuessingNumberGame-v3.0_ALPHA/GuessingNumberGame/target/

<hr>

***Final Considerations:***

---**NOTE:** no comments---;

I hope you enjoy! :)
